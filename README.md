 1. Try to recreate this design as accurate as possible, colors are
    'pink', 'lightblue' and '(255,255,255,0.6)'. 
    Take into account the layer disposition of the image, the text and the decorations (the pink band underneath). 
 2. The design should display adequately to all resolutions.
 3. The animals are ordered and shown alphabetically by their name property.
 4. You have to create a div that allows to show only the same members of a specie.
 5. Once you click in one of the elements the previous items of the list (remember the alphabetical order) are removed from the DOM.

There is no restriction for your solution, you can use a frameworks if it helps you or you can do it directly in vanillaJS. 

A good solution would have a good structured code but don't code it as it would be an application to grow, you can keep it simple and show your skills applying good practices in your JS, HTML and CSS code.
